                <h2>Here's a little bit about me!</h2>
                <h3>Education</h3>
                <p>I am currently enrolled in edX Boot Camps partnering with The Ohio State University to study Fullstack Web Development.
                    The program that I am in is a 24 week intensive course that teaches students the fundamentals of web development,
                    including the following.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>How to build front-end websites from scratch using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript</li>
                    <li>How to create full-stack single-page web applications using RESTful API routes and AJAX methods</li>
                    <li>How to implement structured and unstructured databases to convert static websites into dynamic websites that persist data</li>
                    <li>The fundamentals of source control, issue tracking, and functional feedback</li>
                    <li>Working in teams and using project management skills</li>
                </ul>

            <section class="about-me" id="passion">
                <h3>Passion</h3>
                <p>My passion for programming began during my High School career when I decided to enroll in AP Computer Science Principles my senior year.
                    In that class, I learned the basics of how the internet and computers worked and the basics of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. From there, I gained 
                    the majority of my knowledge of programming when I studied Computer Science at Kent State University from 2019 to 2021. After coming to the decision to hault
                    my education due to personal reasons, I started working as a server at a small Italian Restaurant. However, as time grew, I knew I wanted to get back
                    into programming and reignite my passion for coding. This is when I came across The Ohio State's Coding Boot Camp with edX. After doing my research
                    on the curriculum of the 24 week intensive course, I knew it would be the perfect opportunity for me to jump back into a future filled with endless
                    potential in the booming age of technology. I am incredibly excited to go forth with my decision to continue my education and the opportunities that
                    will arise from it.
